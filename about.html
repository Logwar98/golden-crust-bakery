                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <!--Instead of putting paragraph in their own <p> section i used <br> to make them look like they are different paragraphs.-->
                <p>The Golden Crust Bakery was born out of a shared dream between Sarah and Tom, a couple who had always
                    been passionate about baking. Sarah, a talented pastry chef, and Tom, a skilled bread maker, met
                    while working at a renowned bakery in Wellington. They often talked about opening their own bakery,
                    where they could combine their skills and create a place that felt like home to their customers.
                    <br><br>In 2012, they decided to take the plunge and moved to Gisborne, a town known for its
                    close-knit
                    community and appreciation for local produce. With their savings and a small loan, they found a
                    charming spot in the heart of the town and began transforming it into the Golden Crust Bakery.
                    <br><br>
                    From the very beginning, Sarah and Tom were committed to using the finest, locally sourced
                    ingredients. They spent countless hours perfecting their recipes, ensuring that every loaf of bread
                    and pastry was made with love and care. Their dedication paid off as the bakery quickly became a
                    beloved spot in Gisborne. Locals were drawn to the warm, inviting atmosphere and the delicious aroma
                    of freshly baked goods. Over the years, the Golden Crust Bakery grew, but Sarah and Tom never lost
                    sight of their original vision: to create a bakery that felt like a second home to their customers,
                    where everyone could enjoy the simple pleasure of a well-made loaf of bread or a perfectly baked
                    pastry.
